// CHALLENGE #3
// There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. 
// The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below.
//  The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, and 
// the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print to the console:

// "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or

// "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or

// "Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.



// TEST DATA: Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.



// ðŸ‘‹ OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture

let avgscoreDolphins = (96+108+89)/3;
console.log("avgscoredolphins: ",avgscoreDolphins);

let avgscoreKolas = (88+91+110)/3;
console.log("avgscoreKolas: " , avgscoreKolas);


if(avgscoreDolphins>avgscoreKolas){
    console.log("Dolphins win the trophy");
}
else if(avgscoreDolphins<avgscoreKolas){
    console.log("Koalas win the trophy");
}
